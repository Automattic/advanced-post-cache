ðŸ›‘ DEPRECATION NOTICE
--------

Since WordPress 6.1 Core has now built-in WP_Query caching this plugin is now deprecated. If you're running 6.1+ we suggest removing all integrations dependent on it and disabling the plugin.

Version 0.3.0 simply no-ops the functionality while preserving the API (to avoid potential fatals).

If you're running an older version of WordPress we've prepared the [v0.2.0](https://github.com/Automattic/advanced-post-cache/releases/tag/v0.2.0) release.

If you're installing this plugin via Composer please pin to the above tag.

This repository will be archived soon.
